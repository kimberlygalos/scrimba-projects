        <h2>Background and History</h2>
        <p class="bg_description">
          Intramuros is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the
          Philippines which is located in the city of Manila. The reason itâ€™s
          called Intramuros is that it came from the Latin word which means
          inside the walls. In short, it is a city within the walls. It is
          situated at the site of the former palace of Rajah Sulayman during the
          late fifteenth century. Intramuros have a size of 670000 square meters
          or 0.67 square kilometers. According to its illustrious history,
          Intramuros was planned and built by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in the
          year 1571 during the start of the Spanish colonial period in the
          Philippines. The Spaniards constructed a series of six meters high
          stone walls and fortifications which are bounded by moats on a very
          crucial piece of land on the south bank of the Pasig River which is
          known today as Fort Santiago. It is bordered by Pasig River in the
          north and Manila Bay in the west. Intramuros is known as the Walled
          City because it was mainly built as a defensive curtain to defend the
          occupant from outside aggression. It has a compressed gauze-like
          system of streets and a central square surrounded by government
          offices. The city was predesigned on a compact framework of streets
          encompassed by dozens of cannons, and a couple of moats, and
          safeguarded by bulwarks and ravelins. As the years go by, Intramuros
          is home to several churches, parks, schools, plazas, monasteries, and
          grand government offices. Furthermore, Intramuros accommodate the
          Philippinesâ€™ prosperous families, brilliant students, and most
          authoritative churchly orders during the sixteenth century. Inside the
          Intramuros, thereâ€™s a wide area for the printing press and garrison.
          Also, caravan carts rattled down the cross-roads streets. As a result,
          Manilaâ€™s upper-class families were enthralled in stylish Spanish-style
          architecture every day, and on Sunday, a parade of fashionable
          churchgoers circulate through the cityâ€™s eight gates approaching the
          Manila Cathedral and Plaza Roma. For this reason, Intramuros has been
          the capital city of Metro Manila for many years during the Spanish
          colonial period in the Philippines. As the place of Spanish dominion
          in the Philippines, Intramuros seize the scrutiny of every major
          industrialized country such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
          the United States, and Japan to conquer the Philippines during the
          Industrial Revolution era. Moreover, the Spanish officials command
          that the Chinese could not own houses inside Intramuros, so a growing
          community of Filipino-Chinese was established outside the walls in a
          place known as the Parian de Arroceros. For the past 374 years,
          Intramuros still standing despite a series of fires and earthquakes.
