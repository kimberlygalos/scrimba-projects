          Rizal Park is a historical urban park located in the Ermita district
          along Roxas Boulevard in the city of Manila. It is commonly known to
          many Filipinos as Luneta Park. Rizal Park has a size of 58 hectares or
          580000 square meters. It is one of the largest urban parks in the
          Asian continent and it is juxtaposed to the historic walled city
          Intramuros. Rizal Park is home to several gardens, green lawns,
          artworks, an open field, ponds, paved walks, an observatory, dancing
          fountains, picnic grounds, wooded areas, ornamental gardens, an
          open-air concert hall, an artistsâ€™ sanctuary, other monuments, and an
          open-air auditorium. Rizal Park is bordered by Padre Burgos Avenue on
          the left side, Taft Avenue on the east side, and Kalaw Avenue on the
          right side. In general, Rizal Park is divided into three parts. First
          is the Northeastern part which has a size of 16 hectares and it
          includes the Teodoro F. Valencia Circle, National Museum of
          Anthropology, and National Museum of Natural History. The second is
          the Central part which has a size of 22 hectares and is situated at
          Maria Orosa Street all the way to Roxas Boulevard. The Central parts

          The most famous attraction in Rizal Park is the Rizal Monument because
          it was built to dedicate and admire the Philippinesâ€™ national hero
          Doctor Jose Protasio Rizal. The Rizal Monument is safeguarding
          constantly by ceremonial sentinels and soldiers in full array known as
          the Knights of Rizal. Rizal Monument has a height of 13 meters or 42
          feet. It is where the remains of Jose Rizal lie and it is a very
          significant monument in Philippine History. Beside the Rizal Monument
          is the Independence Flagpole which has a height of 150 feet and is
          considered the tallest flagpole in the Philippines. On the other side
          of the monuments, black carved granite stone can be seen with the
          words coming from the book Mi Ultimo Adios or My Last Farewell by Jose
          Rizal. Aside from this, there are eight bronze statues that rectified
          the final moments of Jose Rizalâ€™s life. Furthermore, in front of the
          Rizal Monument, the Kilometer Zero marble marker can be seen by
          tourists. The prominent Kilometer Zero marble marker serves as the
          reference point or basis for the distance from Manila to another place
          on Luzon island. It served as the point of origin or the zero starting
          point across some provinces and cities in the Philippines. According
          to its illustrious history, Rizal Park was originally built in a
          viscous patch of area known as Paseo de la Luneta near Manila Bay in
          the year 1820 during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines.
          Luneta Park came from the word lunette which means a crescent-shaped
          structure used for fortifications in the seventeenth to eighteenth
          centuries. Formerly, the park was well known to many Filipinos as
          Bagumbayan since 1601.
